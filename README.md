# cardshuffle
the idea is to replicate the physical mechanism of a human dealer shuffling a deck of cards
by cutting the deck, riffling the cut halves back together, and stripping the deck
just like a dealer in Las Vegas would.  
the conceptual issue I've bumped into is how to calculate the muddle of a deck.
I think if I split the deck into 6 stacks and randomly orbited 6 cards from each stack about it
then randomly select one of the stacks and one of the cards orbiting it to move into the muddled deck
and selecting another random card from the 1/6th deck pile to replace the card lost from the orbit of the 1/6th deck pile
and repeating this process untill all the cards from the 1/6th deck piles have been randomly moved into the luddled deck
that it would be an effective physical approximation of a human dealer muddling a deck of cards before shuffling them.
